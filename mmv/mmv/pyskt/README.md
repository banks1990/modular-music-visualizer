Basic gui toolkit with rendering made with Skia

pyskt --> python skia toolkit

Why? because why not?

Yes there is Qt, GTK, .net, tkinter, pygame, kivy, whatever

This is a really dumb idea but I want to see how far I can go with it

Perhaps make it really user friendly to write quick guis like how [DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) does
